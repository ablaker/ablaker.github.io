                                <p>Although I have only been playing Squash for just over a year, my love for the sport continues to grow stronger the more I practice and improve my skills. I'll be honest, I barely knew what squash was two years ago. If you're not familiar with it, it's a sport where you essentially stand in a boxed-in court and hit a ball against the walls - which, i promise, is harder than it sounds! After hearing my dad was in fact quite the prodigy back in college, I decided i'd test my luck - and genetics - and try my hand at it. As a tennis player, it was fairly easy to pick up, and soon enough I was playing in my first tournament. I did not make it as far as I had hoped to, but I enjoyed it enough to keep practicing, and to choose to play it at Taft.  </p>
								<p>I loved playing squash in the winter semester and was honored to be the #1 player. I enjoyed the team experience, competive but sportsmanlike competition, and challenges I was faced with throughout the season. In each match I was tested not only physically, but mentally. In our last match, we played Westminister. It was senior night and my opponent was - you guesssed it - a senior. Parents, coaches, and students flooded the area around my court. My match was the last one to be played meaning everyone was watching - and cheering against me. I was up two games, from which point I knew I had the physical ability and skill to beat her. I would only have to win one more game to take the match. In the third game I began to get in my head. The cheers grew louder, and my confidence began to plummet. After losing the third and fourth games, I truly lost it mentally. I knew I couldn't lose my last match like this. Down 10-11 in the last game, I worried I would make a simple mistake, as I had when I had match point. Needless to say, I won the match; but just barely. I never knew that a sport like squash could ever require as much of a mental capacity as it did physical. Nevertheless, it taught me to push my limits, and, as corny as it sounds, to have faith in my own abilities and that they would carry me to the end, and hopefully to victory.    </p>
